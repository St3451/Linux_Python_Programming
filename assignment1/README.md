# Handin 1
1. Create a directory called "handin1" in your current directory.
2. Inside this directory, create a directory called "test1".
3. Use a Unix command to download the following file: https://wouterboomsma.github.io/lpp2019/data/m_scrambled.txt into a file called "m_scrambled.txt" within the "test1" directory.
4. Make a copy of the "test1" directory, called "test2".
5. Go to the "handin1" directory, and use the "find" command to output all files and directories under this directory.
6. Remove the "test2" directory.
7. Use the "cat" command to take a look at the "m_scrambled.txt" you just downloaded.
8. Find a way to "unscramble" (i.e. make sense of) the image into a new file called "m.txt" (in the "test1" directory).
9. Find a way to download, unscramble and save (into "m.txt") in a single (one-line) command (i.e. combine point 3. and 8.). Again, save it to a file called "m.txt" in the "test1" directory.
10. Delete the "handin1" directory and all directories below it
