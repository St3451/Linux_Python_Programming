# Linux and Python Programming

Linux and Python Programming is the first course I attended in my master of Science in Bioinformatics, it is a bash and python scripting basic course.

This repository contains the weekly assignments and the final exam of the course. In each folder is present a readme file describing the tasks, python and shell script files with completed exercises and, if needed ,other files necessary for the assignment.
