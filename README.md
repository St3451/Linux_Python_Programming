# Linux and Python Programming

Linux and Python programming is the first course I attended in the master of Science in Bioinformatics.

This repository contains the weekly assignments and the final exam of this course. In each folder is present a readme file describing the tasks, python and shell script files with completed exercises and, if needed, other files necessary for the assignment.
