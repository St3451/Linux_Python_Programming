# Linux and Python Programming

Linux and Python programming is the first course I attended in the master of Science in Bioinformatics.

This repository contains the weekly assignments and the final exam of this course. In each folder is present an header describing the tasks, python and shell script files with completed exercises and, if needed, other files necessary for the assignment.
